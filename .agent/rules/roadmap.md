# Roadmap Rule

Before starting any new major task or feature, the agent MUST check `ROADMAP.md` in the project root to understand the current project priorities and planned tasks.
If a user request aligns with an item in the roadmap, the agent should mention it and update the roadmap status as work progresses.
